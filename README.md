MTB Illumina Sequence Analysis and Pangenome Construction

This repository provides scripts, workflows, and documentation for analyzing Illumina sequencing data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), performing variant calling, and constructing a pangenome. The workflow is suitable for both single-end and paired-end Illumina reads and integrates preprocessing, alignment, variant analysis, and downstream pangenome analysis.
