### MTBC Species  
<details>
  <summary>🦠 MTBC Species Overview</summary>

The **Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)** consists of several genetically related species that cause tuberculosis in humans and animals:  

- 🧍 **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** – the primary human pathogen; responsible for the majority of TB cases globally; primarily infects the lungs but can cause extrapulmonary TB.  
- 🐄 **Mycobacterium bovis** – mainly infects cattle; can cause zoonotic TB in humans through unpasteurized dairy or close contact; used in BCG vaccine derivation.  
- 🌍 **Mycobacterium africanum** – largely restricted to West Africa; causes human TB; less virulent than *M. tuberculosis*, but important regionally.  
- 🌿 **Mycobacterium canettii** – rare; mostly reported in East Africa; considered ancestral-like, showing higher genetic diversity; primarily human infections.  
- 🐀 **Mycobacterium microti** – primarily infects wild rodents (voles); occasionally causes TB in humans; used in some experimental TB models.  
- 🦭 **Mycobacterium pinnipedii** – infects seals and other pinnipeds; zoonotic infections are rare in humans.  
- 🐐 **Mycobacterium caprae** – mainly infects goats and other livestock; can occasionally infect humans; prevalent in parts of Europe.  
- 🐖 **Mycobacterium orygis** – infects various wild and domestic animals including antelopes, cattle, and occasionally humans; mainly reported in South Asia.  
- 🐂 **Mycobacterium mungi** – infects banded mongooses in Africa; causes wildlife TB; rare human relevance.  
- 🐘 **Mycobacterium suricattae** – infects meerkats in Southern Africa; wildlife pathogen with ecological importance.  
- 🐏 **Mycobacterium caprae-like strains** – occasionally distinguished in livestock or wildlife; emphasizes host-adapted diversity within MTBC.  

These species differ in **host preference, geographic distribution, virulence, and zoonotic potential**, highlighting the importance of genomic surveillance and comparative studies for TB control.

## Bioinformatics Workflow  

<details>
  <summary>🛠️ TB WGS Bioinformatics Pipeline Overview</summary>

The pipeline includes the following steps:  

1. **📥 Download raw FASTQ from NCBI SRA**  
2. **🧹 Quality control & trimming with `fastp`**  
3. **🎯 Mapping & variant calling with `Snippy`**  
4. **🧬 Resistance & lineage typing with `tb-profiler`**  
5. **🧪 Variant filtering with `tb_variant_filter`**  
6. **📊 Summary QC with `MultiQC`**  
7. **🌳 Phylogenetic tree construction & downstream analysis**  

> This workflow is optimized for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* whole-genome sequencing data.

</details>


# 1️⃣ Download and Inspect FASTQ Data

##  Download Data from NCBI and ENA
Raw sequencing data for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* can be accessed from public repositories such as **NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)** and **European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) / EBI**. These repositories provide high-throughput sequencing datasets submitted by researchers worldwide.  
Key points:  
- **NCBI SRA** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra): Provides raw FASTQ or SRA files that can be downloaded using the `sra-tools` (`prefetch`, `fasterq-dump`) or via FTP.  
- **EBI / ENA** (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home): Offers raw sequencing files (FASTQ) and metadata for projects submitted to Europe’s archive. Supports both browser-based and command-line downloads.  
- Using accession lists (BioProject, Run IDs), data can be downloaded in bulk for large-scale analysis.  
- Metadata includes sample source, sequencing platform, and study information, which is essential for downstream analysis and reproducibility.  

> **Tip:** Always check the sequencing platform and read layout (paired-end vs single-end) to ensure correct processing in your pipeline.  

There are multiple ways to download *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* sequencing data, depending on the dataset size and source. Below are two practical methods.

---

##### Change directory into your working directory
in our setting `~/Genomics_project/TB/fastq_data/f_invio` is our working directory all bioinformatics analysis conducted from this directory 
```bash
cd ~/Genomics_project/TB/fastq_data/f_invio
```

#### Method 1: Using **SRA Explorer** (for small datasets)
1. Go to **[SRA Explorer](https://sra-explorer.info/#)**  
2. Search for a **BioProject number**, e.g., `PRJNA1201357`  
3. Set **Max Results** to `500`  
4. In the search results, check the following options:  
- ✅ *WGS of Mycobacterium tuberculosis*  
- ✅ *Add to collection*  
- ✅ *Go to data saved*  
- ✅ *Bash script for downloading FASTQ files*  
5. Download the generated Bash script (e.g., `sra_download.sh`)  
6. Run the script to download the FASTQ files:  

```bash
bash sra_download.sh
```
> **Tip:** Tip: This method is user-friendly and ideal for small projects (<500 samples). For large-scale datasets, use the command-line method below.

#### Method 2: Using SRA Toolkit / ENA Run Accessions (for large datasets)
##### A. Get all run accessions from ENA
```bash
curl -s "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=PRJEB3334&result=read_run&fields=run_accession" | tail -n +2 > runs.txt
```
<details>
<summary>🌍 Get Run Accessions from ENA</summary>

- `curl -s "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?...` → Queries the ENA API for metadata.  
- `accession=PRJEB3334` → Specifies the BioProject accession (**PRJEB3334** in this case).  
- `result=read_run` → Requests run-level information (one row per sequencing run).  
- `fields=run_accession` → Limits the output to just the **run accession IDs** (SRR/ERR/DRR).  
- `tail -n +2` → Removes the first header line from the API output.  
- `> runs.txt` → Saves all run accession numbers into `runs.txt`.  

📂 The output is a simple text file (`runs.txt`) with one run accession per line, ready for downstream use.  

</details>

#####  B. Get SRR run accessions from NCBI SRA
```bash
esearch -db sra -query PRJNA1104194 | efetch -format runinfo | cut -d',' -f1 | grep ^SRR > runs.txt
```
<details>
<summary>🔎 Get SRR Accessions from NCBI SRA</summary>

- `esearch -db sra -query PRJNA1104194` → Searches the NCBI SRA database for the BioProject ID **PRJNA1104194**.  
- `efetch -format runinfo` → Fetches detailed run metadata in CSV format.  
- `cut -d',' -f1` → Extracts the **first column** (which contains SRR accession numbers).  
- `grep ^SRR` → Filters only rows starting with "SRR".  
- `> runs.txt` → Saves the list of accession numbers into `runs.txt`.  

📂 The result is a clean file (`runs.txt`) with one **SRR accession per line**, ready for download.  
</details>

After we first collect all run accession numbers (SRR/ERR/DRR) from ENA or NCBI SRA and save them into `runs.txt`. Using this list, we download raw sequencing data with `prefetch`, convert `.sra` files to paired-end FASTQ using `fasterq-dump`, compress them with `pigz`/`gzip`, and automatically remove the original `.sra` files once FASTQs are safely stored. Finally, we verify that every sample has both R1 and R2 FASTQ files, leaving us with a clean `raw_data/` directory containing paired and compressed FASTQ files ready for downstream analysis.  


##### Step 1:  Once `runs.txt` is ready, create a download script:
```bash
nano download_sra.sh
```
##### Step 2: Paste the following into the file:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
THREADS=4
OUTDIR="raw_data"; mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"
RUNS="runs.txt"
SRADIR=~/ncbi/public/sra

while read -r ACC; do
    echo "📥 $ACC"

    if ls "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq.gz 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "✅ FASTQ already exists → skipping"
        continue
    fi

    [ -f "$SRADIR/$ACC.sra" ] && echo "✅ SRA exists" || { echo "⬇️ downloading"; prefetch --max-size 100G "$ACC"; }

    echo "⚡ converting"
    fasterq-dump "$ACC" --split-files -e "$THREADS" -O "$OUTDIR"

    command -v pigz &>/dev/null && pigz -p "$THREADS" "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq || gzip "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq

    if ls "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq.gz 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
        rm -f "$SRADIR/$ACC.sra"
        echo "🗑️ removed $ACC.sra"
    fi

    echo "🎯 done"
done < "$RUNS"

echo "🎉 All done!"

```

<details>
<summary>📥 FASTQ Download & Cleanup Script Explanation</summary>

- `#!/bin/bash` → Runs the script with Bash.  
- `set -euo pipefail` → Stops on errors, unset variables, or pipeline failures.  
- `THREADS=4` → Number of CPU threads for `fasterq-dump` and compression.  
- `OUTDIR="raw_data"` → Directory where FASTQ files will be saved.  
- `RUNS="SRR_Acc_List.txt"` → File listing SRA accession numbers.  
- `SRADIR=~/ncbi/public/sra` → Default location where `prefetch` stores `.sra` files.  
- `while read -r ACC; do ... done < "$RUNS"` → Loops through each accession ID.  
- `if ls "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq.gz ...` → Skips processing if FASTQ files already exist.  
- `prefetch --max-size 100G "$ACC"` → Downloads `.sra` file only if not already present.  
- `fasterq-dump "$ACC" --split-files -e "$THREADS" -O "$OUTDIR"` → Converts `.sra` to paired FASTQ files.  
- Compression:  
  - Uses `pigz` (parallel gzip) if installed.  
  - Falls back to `gzip` otherwise.  
- `if ls "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq.gz ... rm -f "$SRADIR/$ACC.sra"` → Automatically deletes `.sra` file after confirming FASTQs were saved.  
- `echo` messages → Provide status updates (`📥`, `✅`, `⚡`, `🎯`, `🎉`).  

</details>

##### Step 3: Save and exit nano
Press Ctrl + O → Enter (to write the file)
Press Ctrl + X → Exit nano
##### Step 4: Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x download_sra.sh
```
##### Step 5: Run the script
```bash
./download_sra.sh
```
### Running the Download Script in the Background

To run our script in the background and keep it running even if we close the terminal, we can use `nohup`. All output and errors will be saved to `run.log`.

```bash
nohup bash download_sra.sh > run.log 2>&1 &
```
Check the progress of your download
```bash
tail -f run.log
```
Check if the script is still running
```bash
ps aux | grep download_sra.sh
```

##  Checking FASTQ 
###  FASTQ Visualization and Summary
This repository contains scripts and commands to **explore and summarize paired-end FASTQ files** for fastq sample and also individual single sample in a bioinformatically meaningful way.

---

### 1. Peek at the first few reads
```bash
zcat raw_data/ET3_S55_1.fastq.gz | head -n 16
zcat raw_data/ET3_S55_2.fastq.gz | head -n 16
```
<details>
<summary>🔍 Inspect First Reads of FASTQ Files</summary>
- `zcat` is a Linux/Unix command used to **view the contents of compressed files** without manually uncompressing them.  
- Works primarily with `.gz` files (gzip-compressed).  
- Unlike `gunzip`, it **prints the uncompressed data to standard output** instead of creating a new file.  
- Example workflow:  
  - `zcat raw_data/ET3_S55_1.fastq.gz | head -n 16` →  Show the first 16 lines of R1 (forward) FASTQ file of a compressed file without extracting it. 


- Each read in FASTQ format consists of 4 lines:  
  1. Header line (`@`) with read ID  
  2. Sequence line  
  3. Separator line (`+`)  
  4. Quality scores line  
  - Useful for:  
  - Checking file format  
  - Inspecting sequences and quality  
  - Ensuring R1 and R2 files are correctly paired  
</details>


### 2. Count total reads
For single sample
```bash
echo $(( $(zcat raw_data/ET3_S55_1.fastq.gz | wc -l) / 4 ))
echo $(( $(zcat raw_data/ET3_S55_2.fastq.gz | wc -l) / 4 ))
```
<details>
<summary>📊 Counting Reads in FASTQ Files</summary>

- `zcat raw_data/ET3_S55_1.fastq.gz` → Decompresses the R1 FASTQ file and sends its content to standard output.  
- `| wc -l` → Counts the total number of lines in the decompressed file.  
- `$(( ... / 4 ))` → **Arithmetic expansion** in Bash: evaluates the expression inside `$(( ))`.  
  - Divides the total number of lines by 4 because **each sequencing read occupies 4 lines** in a FASTQ file:  
    1. Header line (`@`)  
    2. Sequence line  
    3. Separator line (`+`)  
    4. Quality scores line  
- `echo` → Prints the resulting number of reads.  
- The second command works the same for the R2 (reverse) FASTQ file.  
- Overall, these commands give a **quick read count** for paired-end sequencing files.  

</details>


For batch processing 
##### Step 1: Open a new script
```bash
nano count_reads.sh
```
##### Step 2: Paste the following code
This script counts reads in paired-end FASTQ files and saves results to a CSV.

echo "Sample,R1_reads,R2_reads" > "$OUTFILE"
echo "📊 Counting reads in FASTQ files from '$INDIR'..."

for R1 in "$INDIR"/*_1.fastq.gz "$INDIR"/*_R1.fastq.gz; do
    [[ -f "$R1" ]] || continue
    SAMPLE=$(basename "$R1" | sed -E 's/_R?1.*\.fastq\.gz//')
    R2=""
    for suffix in "_2.fastq.gz" "_R2.fastq.gz" "_R2_*.fastq.gz"; do
        [[ -f "$INDIR/${SAMPLE}${suffix}" ]] && R2="$INDIR/${SAMPLE}${suffix}" && break
    done
    R1_COUNT=$(( $(zcat "$R1" | wc -l) / 4 ))
    R2_COUNT=$([[ -n "$R2" ]] && echo $(( $(zcat "$R2" | wc -l) / 4 )) || echo "NA")
    echo "$SAMPLE,$R1_COUNT,$R2_COUNT" >> "$OUTFILE"
    echo "✅ $SAMPLE → R1: $R1_COUNT | R2: $R2_COUNT"
done

### 3. Base composition

- **Assess sequencing quality** → Balanced A, T, G, C indicates good data.  
- **Detect contamination or bias** → Overrepresented bases may signal adapters, low-complexity regions, or contaminants.  
- **Guide quality control** → Helps decide if serious trimming or filtering is needed before analysis.  
- **Prevent downstream errors** → Ensures accurate mapping, variant calling, or assembly.  
✅ **Base composition check is a quick QC step that safeguards analysis quality.**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for fq in raw_data/ET3_S55_1.fastq.gz raw_data/ET3_S55_2.fastq.gz; do
    [ -f "$fq" ] || continue
    echo "Counting bases in $fq..."
    zcat "$fq" | awk 'NR%4==2 { for(i=1;i<=length($0);i++) b[substr($0,i,1)]++ } 
    END { for(base in b) print base, b[base] }'
    echo "----------------------"
done
```
<details>
<summary>🧬 Nucleotide Counting Script Explanation</summary>

- `for fq in raw_data/ET3_S55_1.fastq.gz raw_data/ET3_S55_2.fastq.gz; do ... done` → Loops over the two specified FASTQ files (R1 and R2).  
- `[ -f "$fq" ] || continue` → Skips the iteration if the file does not exist.  
- `echo "Counting bases in $fq..."` → Prints which file is being processed.  
- `zcat "$fq"` → Decompresses the FASTQ file and streams its content to standard output.  
- `awk 'NR%4==2 { for(i=1;i<=length($0);i++) b[substr($0,i,1)]++ } END { for(base in b) print base, b[base] }'` → Counts nucleotides:  
  - `NR%4==2` → Only processes the **sequence line** of each FASTQ read.  
  - `for(i=1;i<=length($0);i++)` → Iterates over each nucleotide in the sequence line.  
  - `b[substr($0,i,1)]++` → Increments a counter for each base (A, T, G, C, N, or other).  
  - `END { for(base in b) print base, b[base] }` → Prints the total counts for each base after processing the file.  
- `echo "----------------------"` → Adds a visual separator between files for readability.  

</details>


### 4. Quality score summary
its good practice to quickly inspect base quality scores for the first few reads before full QC or analysis
- We may spot unusual patterns in base quality that may indicate issues with the sequencing run.

```
##### Step 2: Paste the following into `check_fastq_pairs.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

INDIR="raw_data"
[[ "$(basename "$PWD")" != "raw_data" ]] && cd "$INDIR" || { echo "❌ raw_data directory not found"; exit 1; }

echo "🔍 Checking FASTQ pairings in $PWD ..."

MISSING=false
PAIRED_COUNT=0
TOTAL_COUNT=0

for R1 in *_1.fastq.gz *_R1.fastq.gz *_R1_*.fastq.gz *_001.fastq.gz; do
    [[ -f "$R1" ]] || continue
    TOTAL_COUNT=$((TOTAL_COUNT+1))

        echo "✅ $SAMPLE — paired"
        PAIRED_COUNT=$((PAIRED_COUNT+1))
    else
        echo "❌ $SAMPLE — missing R2 file"
        MISSING=true
    fi
done

echo -e "\nTotal samples checked: $TOTAL_COUNT"
echo "Correctly paired samples: $PAIRED_COUNT"
$MISSING && echo "⚠ Some samples are missing pairs. Fix before running fastp." || echo "✅ All FASTQ files are correctly paired."
```
<details>

# 2️⃣Calculating Minimum, Maximum, and Average Read Lengths for Paired-End Reads

Before performing any downstream bioinformatics analysis, it is important to understand the quality and characteristics of your sequencing data. One key metric is the **read length** of our FASTQ files. 
- **Minimum read length:** Helps identify very short reads that may result from sequencing errors or trimming. Extremely short reads can cause mapping errors or low-quality variant calls.  
- **Maximum read length:** Confirms whether reads were sequenced to the expected length and identifies unusually long reads that may indicate adapter contamination or sequencing artifacts. - **Average read length:** Provides an overall measure of the sequencing quality and consistency across the dataset.
Calculating these metrics for **both R1 and R2 reads** is particularly important in paired-end sequencing:
- Ensures that both reads in a pair are of comparable lengths, which is crucial for accurate alignment and variant calling.  
- Detects any discrepancies between forward and reverse reads that could indicate technical issues during sequencing or library preparation.  
- Allows early filtering of problematic samples before running computationally intensive steps such as mapping, variant calling, or assembly.  

By summarizing read lengths in a **CSV file**, we could able to quickly inspect our dataset, compare samples, and make informed decisions on trimming, filtering, or quality control. This step improves the reliability and reproducibility of downstream analyses.

# 3️⃣ FASTP – Quality Control and Trimming

<details>
<summary>⚡ FASTQ Preprocessing with fastp</summary>

[`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is a widely used **FASTQ preprocessor** for quality control (QC), read trimming, and adapter removal. It is efficient, multithreaded, and provides both **JSON and HTML reports** for each sample.  

In this pipeline, `fastp` ensures that only **high-quality reads** are retained before mapping and variant calling. High-quality read preprocessing is crucial in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (TB) WGS analysis because poorly trimmed or unfiltered reads can lead to:
- False-positive SNP calls  
- Mapping errors, especially in repetitive regions (e.g., PE/PPE genes)  
- Biased coverage, affecting downstream variant interpretation  

### Advantages of fastp over Trimmomatic and other tools
- **All-in-one solution**: Handles trimming, adapter detection, filtering, and QC in a single step.  
- **Automatic adapter detection**: Reduces human error, especially for large TB projects with mixed sequencing batches.  
- **Speed and multithreading**: Written in C++, much faster than Java-based Trimmomatic.  
- **Comprehensive QC output**: HTML (interactive) and JSON (machine-readable) reports for quality distribution, duplication rates, adapter content, and polyG/polyX tails.  
- **Better polyG/polyX handling**: Important for Illumina NovaSeq/NextSeq data.  
- **UMI support**: Useful for advanced TB sequencing protocols using Unique Molecular Identifiers.  
- **Minimal parameter tuning**: Default settings are optimized, reducing manual adjustments.  

### Why this matters for TB analysis
- **Accurate SNP calling**: TB drug-resistance prediction relies on high-confidence SNPs.  
- **Low genetic diversity detection**: TB isolates often differ by only a few SNPs. Filtering errors while retaining true variants is critical.  
- **Scalability for large cohorts**: Efficient, reproducible preprocessing is essential for thousands of public TB isolates from ENA/NCBI.

# 4️⃣ MultiQC

<details>
<summary>📊 Aggregating QC with MultiQC</summary>

After preprocessing with `fastp`, we often generate dozens or hundreds of per-sample QC reports (`.html` and `.json`). Instead of checking each report manually, **MultiQC** aggregates all results into a single interactive HTML report.  

### Why we use MultiQC in TB analysis
- **Aggregated QC overview**: Summarizes all `fastp` results in one place.  
- **Consistency check**: Quickly detects outlier samples (e.g., unusually short reads, poor quality, or failed trimming).  
- **Scalable**: Handles hundreds or thousands of TB isolates efficiently.  
- **Standardized reporting**: Facilitates sharing results across teams or for publications.

# 8️⃣ TB Variant Filter
<details>
<summary>🧬 TB-Specific Variant Filtering with tb_variant_filter</summary>

The **tb_variant_filter** tool is tailored for **Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb)** sequencing data. Unlike general-purpose filters, it considers TB-specific genomic features and problematic regions in the **H37Rv reference genome** to retain only **high-confidence variants**.

### Why filtering matters
Raw variant calls from Snippy or other callers often include:
- **False positives** from sequencing errors or mapping ambiguity.  
- Variants in **repetitive regions**, where reads cannot be uniquely aligned.  
- Low-quality calls with insufficient coverage or poor base quality.  

Unfiltered variants can:
- Lead to **incorrect drug resistance predictions**.  
- Introduce **noise in phylogenetic analyses**, misrepresenting transmission clusters.  
- Inflate **SNP distances**, causing misinterpretation of outbreaks.  

### What tb_variant_filter does
1. **Mask problematic genomic regions**  
   - Excludes SNPs in highly repetitive or poorly mappable regions (e.g., **PE/PPE gene families**, mobile genetic elements).  
2. **Depth-based filtering**  
   - Removes variants with **low read depth**, ensuring reliable calls.  
3. **Quality-based filtering**  
   - Discards variants with **low base or mapping quality**.  
4. **Retains core genome SNPs**  
   - Focuses on SNPs in **conserved coding regions**, suitable for drug resistance prediction and phylogenetic analysis.  
## ✅ Benefits of Using `tb_variant_filter`
- **TB-specific**: Tailored to the H37Rv reference genome.  
- **Improved accuracy**: Removes false positives that generic tools often miss.  
- **Reliable resistance prediction**: Only keeps SNPs truly linked to drug resistance.  
- **Cleaner phylogenies**: Results in more robust clustering and outbreak inference.  
- **Standardization**: Widely adopted in TB genomic epidemiology pipelines, making results comparable across studies.

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Check Consensus FASTA Lengths

After generating consensus sequences, it's important to **verify the genome length** for each sample.  
This ensures no sequences are truncated or incomplete due to missing coverage or filtering.

---

### 📏 Calculating Consensus Genome Lengths

We can check the length of each consensus FASTA sequence to ensure completeness and consistency.  
This helps verify that consensus sequences cover the full *M. tuberculosis* genome (~4.4 Mbp) and can reveal missing regions.

### Using `grep` and `wc`
We remove the FASTA headers (`>` lines) and count the remaining nucleotides to get the total genome length:

```bash
for f in consensus_sequences/*.fasta; do
    sample=$(basename "$f")
    # Remove header lines and count remaining characters
    length=$(grep -v ">" "$f" | tr -d '\n' | wc -c)
    echo "$sample : $length bp"
done
```

to save the result in csv file 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
FASTA_DIR="consensus_sequences"
OUTPUT_CSV="consensus_lengths.csv"
echo "Sample,Length_bp" > "$OUTPUT_CSV"

for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fasta; do
    sample=$(basename "$f" .fasta)
    length=$(grep -v ">" "$f" | tr -d '\n' | wc -c)
    echo "$sample,$length" >> "$OUTPUT_CSV"
done

echo "✅ Consensus genome lengths saved to $OUTPUT_CSV"

```
<details>
<summary>📖 Explanation of the calculating consensus genome lengths calculation and saving the result in csv</summary>

- `FASTA_DIR="consensus_sequences"` → sets the directory containing consensus FASTA files.  
- `OUTPUT_CSV="consensus_lengths.csv"` → defines the CSV file to save lengths.  
- `echo "Sample,Length_bp" > "$OUTPUT_CSV"` → creates the CSV file and writes the header line.  
- `for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fasta; do ... done` → loops over all FASTA files in the directory.  
- `sample=$(basename "$f" .fasta)` → extracts the sample name from the FASTA filename.  
- `length=$(grep -v ">" "$f" | tr -d '\n' | wc -c)` → removes header lines (`>`), concatenates sequences into one line, and counts nucleotides.  
- `echo "$sample,$length" >> "$OUTPUT_CSV"` → appends the sample name and its sequence length to the CSV file.  
- `echo "✅ Consensus genome lengths saved to $OUTPUT_CSV"` → prints a completion message when finished.  

</details>

### Rename the FASTA files

```bash
#!/bin/bash
FASTA_DIR="consensus_sequences"
for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.snps.filtered.consensus.fasta; do
    mv "$f" "${f/.snps.filtered.consensus/}"
done
echo "✅ All consensus FASTA files have been renamed."

```

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Multiple Sequence Alignment with MAFFT

MAFFT v7.490 requires **a single FASTA file** as input.  
It **cannot take multiple FASTA files** on the command line directly, otherwise it interprets filenames as options.

---

##### Step 1: Merge all consensus FASTAs
Combine all individual consensus sequences into one multi-FASTA file:

```bash
cat consensus_sequences/*.fasta > consensus_sequences/all_consensus.fasta
```
##### Step 2: Run MAFFT
Perform multiple sequence alignment on the merged file:
Use a faster algorithm than --auto

--auto lets MAFFT decide, but for hundreds/thousands of sequences, it often picks a slower iterative refinement.
You can explicitly pick faster modes:

Since Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes are highly conserved and we care more about speed than very small accuracy gains, we can safely drop the expensive iterative refinement steps in MAFFT.
fast and TB-suitable command

```bash
mafft --retree 2 --maxiterate 0 --thread -1 consensus_sequences/all_consensus.fasta > consensus_sequences/aligned_consensus.fasta
```
<details>
<summary>🔹 Why these settings are suitable for TB</summary>

- `--retree 2` → Rebuilds the guide tree twice (sufficient for closely related TB genomes).  
- `--maxiterate 0` → Skips iterative refinement (speeds up alignment).  
- `--thread -1` → Uses all available CPU cores automatically.  
- Accuracy loss is minimal because MTBC genomes are >99% identical.

</details>

If we have very many genomes ( >1000 ) and want maximum speed, switch to:
```bash
mafft --parttree --retree 2 --maxiterate 0 --thread -1 consensus_sequences/all_consensus.fasta > consensus_sequences/aligned_consensus.fasta
```

##### Step 3: Verify the alignment
Quickly inspect the top of the aligned FASTA:
```bash
head consensus_sequences/aligned_consensus.fasta
```

#1️⃣3️⃣ Shovill
<details>
<summary>🏗️ Shovill: Bacterial Genome Assembler</summary>

**Shovill** is a fast and easy-to-use **bacterial genome assembler** designed for Illumina short-read data. It wraps around popular assemblers like **SPAdes** or **SKESA**, streamlining genome assembly from paired-end reads.

### Key points for TB genomes
- Optimized for **small bacterial genomes** (~4–5 Mb).  
- Supports multithreading (`--cpus`) and efficient RAM usage (`--ram`) for faster assemblies.  
- Allows customization of **minimum contig length** (`--minlen`) and **coverage depth** (`--mincov` / `--depth`).  
- Automatically renames output contigs for clarity and downstream analyses.  
- Works well with **preprocessed FASTQ files** from `fastp`.  

> ⚠ **Note:** Best used with high-quality, paired-end Illumina reads. Low-quality or fragmented data may require additional QC before assembly.

##### Step 1: Create or edit the script
```bash
nano run_shovill.sh
```
#####  Step 2: Paste the following into `run_shovill.sh`

```bash

<details>
<summary>📖 Explanation of Shovill Pipeline Script</summary>

- `INPUT_DIR="fastp_results_min_50"` → directory with preprocessed FASTQ files.  
- `OUTDIR="shovill_results"` → directory to store Shovill assemblies.  
- `mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"` → ensures output directory exists.  
- `GSIZE=4411532` → approximate genome size for M. tuberculosis (~4.41 Mb).  
- `shopt -s nullglob` → makes the loop skip if no matching files exist.  

**Loop over samples:**  
- `for R1 in "$INPUT_DIR"/*_1.trim.fastq.gz; do ... done` → loops over all R1 FASTQ files.  
- `R2="${R1/_1.trim.fastq.gz/_2.trim.fastq.gz}"` → guesses corresponding R2 file.  
- `if [[ ! -f "$R2" ]]; then ... fi` → skips sample if R2 is missing.  
- `sample=$(basename "$R1" _1.trim.fastq.gz)` → extracts sample name.  
- `sample_out="$OUTDIR/$sample"` → defines sample-specific output folder.  
- `if [[ -f "$sample_out/${sample}_contigs.fa" ]]; then ... fi` → skips assembly if contigs already exist.  

**Shovill command parameters:**  
- `--R1/--R2` → input paired-end reads  
- `--gsize` → genome size  
- `--outdir` → output directory  
- `--assembler skesa` → use SKESA assembler  
- `--minlen 500` → minimum contig length  
- `--mincov 5` → minimum coverage  
- `--depth 100` → target depth  
- `--namefmt "${sample}_%05d"` → output naming format  
- `--cpus 4` → CPU threads  
- `--ram 16` → RAM in GB  
- `--tmpdir` → temporary directory  
- `--force` → overwrite existing files  

**Post-processing:**  
- `for f in "$sample_out"/*; do ... done` → renames all files to include sample prefix.

#  Assembly Evaluation

Before downstream analyses, it is important to verify the quality of the assembled genome. This ensures reliable results in variant calling, consensus generation, and phylogenetic analyses.
### 1. Quick assembly stats using `stats.sh`

The `stats.sh` script from BBMap provides basic assembly statistics such as total length, N50, number of contigs, and GC content.
###### Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate bbmap_env
```
###### Run stats.sh to Verify Installation
```bash
stats.sh
```

######  run `stats.sh`
```bash
stats.sh in=./shovill_results/ET1135_S12/ET1135_S12_contigs.fa
```
> **Tip:** This command will display key statistics including:
> 
> - Total bases
> - Number of contigs
> - Minimum, maximum, and N50 contig lengths
> - GC content


loop over multiple assemblies:
```bash
for f in ./shovill_results/*/*_contigs.fa; do
    stats.sh in="$f"
done
```
script that will loop over all contig FASTA files, run stats.sh from BBMap, and save the results to a CSV file:
##### Step 1: Create or edit the script
```bash
nano run_assembly_stats.sh
```
##### Step 2: Paste the following into the script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

CONTIG_DIR="./shovill_results"
OUTPUT_CSV="assembly_stats.csv"

echo "Sample,Total_Bases,Num_Contigs,Min_Contig,Max_Contig,N50,GC_Content" > "$OUTPUT_CSV"

for f in "$CONTIG_DIR"/*/*_contigs.fa; do
    sample=$(basename "$f" _contigs.fa)
    
    stats_output=$(stats.sh in="$f" format=tsv 2>/dev/null | tail -n 1)
    
    total=$(echo "$stats_output" | cut -f1)
    num=$(echo "$stats_output" | cut -f3)
    min=$(echo "$stats_output" | cut -f4)
    max=$(echo "$stats_output" | cut -f5)
    n50=$(echo "$stats_output" | cut -f6)
    gc=$(echo "$stats_output" | cut -f8)
    
    echo "$sample,$total,$num,$min,$max,$n50,$gc" >> "$OUTPUT_CSV"
done

echo "✅ Assembly stats saved to $OUTPUT_CSV"
```

#1️⃣4️⃣ Prokka
Prokka is a rapid **prokaryotic genome annotation tool** that predicts genes, coding sequences (CDS), rRNAs, tRNAs, and other genomic features from assembled contigs or genomes.  

Key points for TB genomes:

- Annotates **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** genomes with correct taxonomy using `--genus` and `--species`.  
- Produces multiple output files, including **GFF3**, **FASTA of proteins**, and **GenBank format**, which are useful for downstream analysis.  
- Supports **multi-threading** (`--cpus`) to speed up processing of multiple genomes.  
- Works seamlessly with **Shovill-assembled contigs**.  
- Output files are organized per sample directory with a consistent naming prefix for easy pipeline integration.  

> ⚠ Note: Prokka relies on the quality of the assembly; fragmented or low-coverage assemblies may result in incomplete annotations.
##### Step 1: Create or edit the script
```bash
nano run_prokka.sh
```
##### Step 2: Paste the following into the script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

SHOVILL_DIR="shovill_results"
PROKKA_DIR="prokka_results"
mkdir -p "$PROKKA_DIR"

for sample_out in "$SHOVILL_DIR"/*; do
  [[ -d "$sample_out" ]] || continue

  sample=$(basename "$sample_out")

  contigs=$(ls "$sample_out"/*_contigs.fa 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)
  if [[ -z "$contigs" ]]; then
    echo ">> Skipping $sample (no contigs.fa found)" >&2
    continue
  fi

  echo "==> Running Prokka on sample: $sample"

  outdir="$PROKKA_DIR/$sample"
  mkdir -p "$outdir"

  prokka \
    --outdir "$outdir" \
    --prefix "$sample" \
    --kingdom Bacteria \
    --genus Mycobacterium \
    --species tuberculosis \
    --cpus 4 \
    "$contigs"
done
