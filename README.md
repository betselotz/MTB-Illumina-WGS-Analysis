## Introduction – *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* Complex (MTBC)  

- *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex (MTBC) comprises closely related bacterial species causing tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals.  
- TB remains a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide.  
- MTBC is characterized by a **highly clonal genome**, with limited horizontal gene transfer, making genomic analysis crucial for understanding evolution, transmission, and drug resistance.  
- **Genome size:** ~4.4 Mbp  
- **GC content:** ~65%  
- Comparative genomics reveals **lineage-specific SNPs**, large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs), and regions of difference (RDs) that are useful for strain typing and epidemiology.  
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) enables:  
  - Identification of **drug-resistance mutations** in key genes (e.g., *rpoB*, *katG*, *inhA*).  
  - Phylogenetic analysis to trace transmission chains and outbreak sources.  
  - Detection of genomic diversity and microevolution within hosts and populations.  
- MTBC genomics informs public health strategies, including **molecular surveillance, outbreak investigation, and personalized TB treatment**.

### MTBC Species  

The *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex (MTBC) includes several closely related species:  

- *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* – the main human pathogen  
- *Mycobacterium bovis* – primarily infects cattle, can cause zoonotic TB in humans  
- *Mycobacterium africanum* – restricted to West Africa, causes human TB  
- *Mycobacterium canettii* – rare, mostly in East Africa, ancestral-like strains  
- *Mycobacterium microti* – primarily infects voles, occasionally humans  
- *Mycobacterium pinnipedii* – infects seals, rarely humans  
- *Mycobacterium caprae* – mainly infects goats, occasionally humans  

---  

### *M. tuberculosis* Lineages  

Genomic studies have identified **10 major lineages** based on SNPs and phylogeny:  

1. **Lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic)** – East Africa, India, Southeast Asia  
2. **Lineage 2 (East-Asian / Beijing)** – East Asia, associated with drug resistance  
3. **Lineage 3 (East-African-Indian)** – South Asia, East Africa  
4. **Lineage 4 (Euro-American)** – Worldwide, highly prevalent  
5. **Lineage 5 (West African 1 / *M. africanum*)** – West Africa  
6. **Lineage 6 (West African 2 / *M. africanum*)** – West Africa  
7. **Lineage 7** – restricted to Ethiopia, ancient lineage with unique genomic markers  
8. **Lineage 8** – discovered in Rwanda and Uganda, deep-branching, highly ancestral  
9. **Lineage 9** – identified in East Africa, distinct SNP profile, rare  
10. **Lineage 10** – recently reported, limited information, potentially from East/Central Africa  

> Understanding MTBC species and lineages is critical for **epidemiology, phylogenetics, and drug-resistance surveillance**.  

---  

### *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* Sublineages  

*M. tuberculosis* lineages are further divided into **sublineages** based on phylogenetic SNP markers:  

- **Lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic):** L1.1, L1.2  
- **Lineage 2 (East-Asian / Beijing):** L2.1 (Proto-Beijing), L2.2 (Modern Beijing)  
- **Lineage 3 (East-African-Indian):** L3.1, L3.2  
- **Lineage 4 (Euro-American):** L4.1, L4.2, L4.3, L4.4, L4.5, etc.  
- **Lineage 5–10:** Mainly restricted to Africa, with limited sublineage descriptions due to low prevalence and recent discovery  

> Sublineages help in **tracking transmission chains, outbreak sources, and population structure**.

## Bioinformatics Workflow  

The pipeline includes the following steps:  

1. **📥 Download raw FASTQ from NCBI SRA**  
2. **🧹 Quality control & trimming with `fastp`**  
3. **🎯 Mapping & variant calling with `Snippy`**  
4. **🧬 Resistance & lineage typing with `tb-profiler`**  
5. **🧪 Variant filtering with `tb_variant_filter`**  
6. **📊 Summary QC with `MultiQC`**  
7. **🌳 Phylogenetic tree construction & downstream analysis**  


### Download Data from NCBI and ENA

Raw sequencing data for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* can be accessed from public repositories such as **NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)** and **European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) / EBI**. These repositories provide high-throughput sequencing datasets submitted by researchers worldwide.  

Key points:  
- **NCBI SRA** (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra): Provides raw FASTQ or SRA files that can be downloaded using the `sra-tools` (`prefetch`, `fasterq-dump`) or via FTP.  
- **EBI / ENA** (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home): Offers raw sequencing files (FASTQ) and metadata for projects submitted to Europe’s archive. Supports both browser-based and command-line downloads.  
- Using accession lists (BioProject, Run IDs), data can be downloaded in bulk for large-scale analysis.  
- Metadata includes sample source, sequencing platform, and study information, which is essential for downstream analysis and reproducibility.  

> **Tip:** Always check the sequencing platform and read layout (paired-end vs single-end) to ensure correct processing in your pipeline.  

There are multiple ways to download *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* sequencing data, depending on the dataset size and source. Below are two practical methods.

---

#### Method 1: Using **SRA Explorer** (for small datasets)

1. Go to **[SRA Explorer](https://sra-explorer.info/#)**  
2. Search for a **BioProject number**, e.g., `PRJNA1201357`  
3. Set **Max Results** to `500`  

4. In the search results, check the following options:  
- ✅ *WGS of Mycobacterium tuberculosis*  
- ✅ *Add to collection*  
- ✅ *Go to data saved*  
- ✅ *Bash script for downloading FASTQ files*  

5. Download the generated Bash script (e.g., `sra_download.sh`)  
6. Run the script to download the FASTQ files:  

```bash
bash sra_download.sh
```
> **Tip:** Tip: This method is user-friendly and ideal for small projects (<500 samples). For large-scale datasets, use the command-line method below.

#### Method 2: Using SRA Toolkit / ENA Run Accessions (for large datasets)
##### A. Get all run accessions from ENA
```bash
curl -s "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api/filereport?accession=PRJEB3334&result=read_run&fields=run_accession" | tail -n +2 > runs.txt
```
#####  B. Get SRR run accessions from NCBI SRA
```bash
esearch -db sra -query PRJNA1201357 | efetch -format runinfo | cut -d',' -f1 | grep ^SRR > runs.txt
```
Once `runs.txt` is ready, create a download script:
```bash
nano download_sra.sh
```
Paste the following into the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Number of threads for fasterq-dump / pigz
THREADS=4

# Directory for FASTQ files
OUTDIR="fastq_files"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"

# File containing run accessions
RUNS="SRR_Acc_List.txt"

# Directory where SRA files are stored by default
SRADIR=~/ncbi/public/sra

# Loop over each accession
while read -r ACC; do
    echo "==> Processing $ACC ..."

    # Skip download if SRA file already exists
    if [ -f "$SRADIR/$ACC.sra" ]; then
        echo "SRA file $ACC.sra already exists, skipping prefetch."
    else
        echo "Downloading $ACC.sra ..."
        prefetch --max-size 100G "$ACC"
    fi

    # Skip conversion if FASTQ already exists
    if ls "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq.gz 1> /dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "FASTQ for $ACC already exists, skipping fasterq-dump."
    else
        # Convert to FASTQ (split paired-end reads)
        fasterq-dump "$ACC" --split-files -e "$THREADS" -O "$OUTDIR"

        # Compress FASTQ files
        if command -v pigz &> /dev/null; then
            pigz -p "$THREADS" "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq
        else
            gzip "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq
        fi
    fi

    # Optional: remove SRA file after successful FASTQ creation
    if ls "$OUTDIR"/${ACC}*.fastq.gz 1> /dev/null 2>&1; then
        rm -f "$SRADIR/$ACC.sra"
    fi

    echo "==> Completed $ACC"
    echo
done < "$RUNS"

echo "🎉 All downloads and conversions completed!"

```

> **Tips for large-scale projects:**
> 
> - Adjust `THREADS` according to your CPU cores for faster downloads.
> - Ensure enough disk space; SRA files can be large (~10–50 GB per sample).
> - Use `pigz` for parallel compression to speed up gzip operations.
> - This method is reproducible and scalable for **hundreds to thousands of samples**.

### Running the Download Script in the Background

To run your script in the background and keep it running even if you close the terminal, use `nohup`. All output and errors will be saved to `run.log`.

```bash
nohup bash download_sra.sh > run.log 2>&1 &
```
Check the progress of your download
```bash
tail -f run.log
```
Check if the script is still running
```bash
ps aux | grep download_sra.sh
```


# 🧬 FASTQ Pair Checking and Download Workflow for MTB WGS

This guide demonstrates how to:

1. Check that all your FASTQ files are correctly paired.
2. Download *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* raw sequencing data using **SRA Explorer** or **SRA Toolkit / ENA**.
3. Run the download scripts in the background for large datasets.

---

## Initial Notes

Before starting, make sure you have:

- `sra-tools` installed (`prefetch`, `fasterq-dump`, `esearch`, `efetch`)
- `pigz` for parallel compression (optional, but recommended for large files)
- Enough disk space for raw and compressed FASTQ files
- Access to your working directory for downloads

---

## 1️⃣ Checking FASTQ Pairing

Ensure all FASTQ files are correctly paired before running any trimming or analysis.

##### Step 1: Change directory into your working directory
```bash
cd ~/Genomics_project/TB/fastq_data/f_invio
```
##### Step 2: Create the script
```bash
nano check_fastq_pairs.sh
```
##### Step 3: Paste the following into `check_fastq_pairs.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

INDIR="raw_data"

# Only cd if not already in raw_data
if [[ "$(basename "$PWD")" != "raw_data" ]]; then
    cd "$INDIR" || { echo "❌ raw_data directory not found"; exit 1; }
fi

echo "🔍 Checking FASTQ pairings in $PWD ..."

MISSING=false
PAIRED_COUNT=0
TOTAL_COUNT=0

# Loop over common R1 patterns
for R1 in *_1.fastq.gz *_R1.fastq.gz *_R1_*.fastq.gz *_001.fastq.gz; do
    [[ -f "$R1" ]] || continue

    TOTAL_COUNT=$((TOTAL_COUNT+1))

    # Extract sample name by removing R1/1/001 suffix
    SAMPLE=${R1%_1.fastq.gz}
    SAMPLE=${SAMPLE%_R1.fastq.gz}
    SAMPLE=${SAMPLE%_R1_*.fastq.gz}
    SAMPLE=${SAMPLE%_001.fastq.gz}
    SAMPLE=${SAMPLE%_R1_001.fastq.gz}

    # Look for corresponding R2
    if [[ -f "${SAMPLE}_2.fastq.gz" || -f "${SAMPLE}_R2.fastq.gz" || -f "${SAMPLE}_R2_*.fastq.gz" || -f "${SAMPLE}_002.fastq.gz" ]]; then
        echo "✅ $SAMPLE — paired"
        PAIRED_COUNT=$((PAIRED_COUNT+1))
    else
        echo "❌ $SAMPLE — missing R2 file"
        MISSING=true
    fi
done

echo -e "\nTotal samples checked: $TOTAL_COUNT"
echo "Correctly paired samples: $PAIRED_COUNT"

if [ "$MISSING" = true ]; then
    echo "⚠ Some samples are missing pairs. Fix before running fastp."
else
    echo "✅ All FASTQ files are correctly paired."
fi
```
##### Step 4: Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x check_fastq_pairs.sh
```
##### Step 5: Run the script
```bash
./check_fastq_pairs.sh
```
> **Tip:** Ensure all R1/R2 naming conventions in your directory match the patterns used in the script.  
> You can adjust the patterns (`*_1.fastq.gz`, `*_R1.fastq.gz`, etc.) if needed.


# 2️⃣Calculating Minimum, Maximum, and Average Read Lengths for Paired-End Reads

Before performing any downstream bioinformatics analysis, it is important to understand the quality and characteristics of your sequencing data. One key metric is the **read length** of your FASTQ files. 

- **Minimum read length:** Helps identify very short reads that may result from sequencing errors or trimming. Extremely short reads can cause mapping errors or low-quality variant calls.  
- **Maximum read length:** Confirms whether reads were sequenced to the expected length and identifies unusually long reads that may indicate adapter contamination or sequencing artifacts.  
- **Average read length:** Provides an overall measure of the sequencing quality and consistency across the dataset.

Calculating these metrics for **both R1 and R2 reads** is particularly important in paired-end sequencing:

- Ensures that both reads in a pair are of comparable lengths, which is crucial for accurate alignment and variant calling.  
- Detects any discrepancies between forward and reverse reads that could indicate technical issues during sequencing or library preparation.  
- Allows early filtering of problematic samples before running computationally intensive steps such as mapping, variant calling, or assembly.  

By summarizing read lengths in a **CSV file**, you can quickly inspect your dataset, compare samples, and make informed decisions on trimming, filtering, or quality control. This step improves the reliability and reproducibility of downstream analyses.

# 3️⃣ FASTP – Quality Control and Trimming

[`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is a widely used **FASTQ preprocessor** for quality control (QC), read trimming, and adapter removal. It is efficient, multithreaded, and provides both **JSON and HTML reports** for each sample.  
In this pipeline, `fastp` is used to ensure that only **high-quality reads** are retained before mapping and variant calling.  
High-quality read preprocessing is crucial in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (TB) whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. Poorly trimmed or unfiltered reads can lead to:
- False-positive SNP calls
- Mapping errors, especially in repetitive regions (e.g., PE/PPE genes)
- Biased coverage, affecting downstream variant interpretation

### Advantages of fastp over Trimmomatic and other tools
- **All-in-one solution**: Unlike Trimmomatic (which often requires extra tools for QC reports), `fastp` handles trimming, adapter detection, filtering, and QC in a single step.  
- **Automatic adapter detection**: No need to manually supply adapter sequences, which reduces human error. This is especially helpful for large TB projects with mixed sequencing batches.  
- **Speed and multithreading**: `fastp` is written in C++ and is **much faster** than Trimmomatic (Java-based), making it well-suited for high-throughput TB datasets.  
- **Comprehensive QC output**: Generates both HTML (interactive) and JSON (machine-readable) reports, giving insights into quality distribution, duplication rates, adapter content, and polyG/polyX tails.  
- **Better polyG/polyX handling**: Important for Illumina NovaSeq/NextSeq data (common in TB studies), where artificial polyG tails are a known issue.  
- **UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) support**: Useful in advanced TB sequencing protocols where UMIs are used for error correction.  
- **Minimal parameter tuning**: Default settings are optimized and generally require fewer manual adjustments than Trimmomatic, reducing complexity in standardized pipelines.  

### Why this matters for TB analysis
- **Accurate SNP calling**: TB drug-resistance prediction relies on high-confidence SNPs; poor-quality reads increase false positives.  
- **Low genetic diversity detection**: TB isolates often differ by only a handful of SNPs. Retaining true biological variants while filtering sequencing errors is critical.  
- **Scalability for large cohorts**: Public datasets (e.g., thousands of TB isolates from ENA/NCBI) require efficient, reproducible, and automated preprocessing — a role where `fastp` excels.

# 4️⃣ MultiQC

After preprocessing with `fastp`, we often end up with dozens or even hundreds of per-sample QC reports (`.html` and `.json`). Instead of checking each report manually, **MultiQC** allows us to aggregate all results into a single interactive HTML report.  

### Why we use MultiQC in TB analysis
- **Aggregated QC overview**: Summarizes all `fastp` results in one place.  
- **Consistency check**: Helps us quickly detect outlier samples (e.g., unusually short reads, poor quality, or failed trimming).  
- **Scalable**: Works seamlessly for hundreds or thousands of TB isolates.  
- **Standardized reporting**: Essential for sharing results across teams or publications.  

---

### Script: Run MultiQC
##### Step 1: **Open nano to create the script `run_multiqc.sh`
```bash
nano run_multiqc.sh
```
##### Step 2: Paste the following code into nano
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

INPUT_DIR="fastp_results_min_50"
OUTPUT_DIR="multiqc_output"

mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"
multiqc "$INPUT_DIR" -o "$OUTPUT_DIR"
```
##### Step 3: Save & exit nano
Press CTRL+O, Enter (save)

```
##### Step 5: Activate your conda env and run
```bash
conda activate multiqc_env
./run_multiqc.sh
```


# 5️⃣ Snippy

`Snippy` is a rapid variant calling and consensus generation pipeline designed for bacterial genomes.  
In **tuberculosis genomics**, Snippy is particularly useful because:  
- It maps reads directly to a reference genome (e.g., *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv).  
- It calls SNPs and produces high-quality consensus FASTA sequences.  
- It is reproducible and lightweight, making it ideal for large TB WGS datasets.  
- Outputs are standardized and easily used for downstream tools (phylogenetics, TBProfiler, etc.).

# 6️⃣ Qualimap BAM QC

Once we generate BAM files with Snippy, it is important to assess their quality before moving to downstream analyses.  
**Qualimap** is widely used for this because:  
- It evaluates mapping quality, coverage distribution, and GC content.  
- It produces both **HTML** and **PDF** reports with easy-to-interpret QC metrics.  
- In TB genomics, it helps us quickly identify problematic samples with low coverage, uneven depth, or poor alignment to the H37Rv reference.  
- The results can later be aggregated with MultiQC for batch reporting.  

---

##### Step 1: Create the script
```bash
nano run_qualimap.sh
```
#####  Step 2: Paste the following into `run_qualimap.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Directory with Snippy BAM files
SNIPPY_DIR="all_bams"

# Output directory for Qualimap reports
QUALIMAP_OUT="qualimap_reports"
mkdir -p "$QUALIMAP_OUT"

for bam in "$SNIPPY_DIR"/*.bam; do
    sample=$(basename "$bam" .bam)
    echo "Running Qualimap BAM QC for sample: $sample"

    outdir="${QUALIMAP_OUT}/${sample}"
    mkdir -p "$outdir"

    # Run Qualimap (both HTML and PDF for completeness)
    qualimap bamqc \
        -bam "$bam" \
        -outdir "$outdir" \
        -outformat pdf:html \
        --java-mem-size=4G

    # MultiQC will later scan these reports
done
```
##### Step 3: Save and exit nano

Press Ctrl + O, then Enter (save)
Press Ctrl + X (exit)
##### Step 4: Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x run_qualimap.sh
```
##### Step 5: Activate environment and install GNU Parallel into your `qualimap_env`:
```bash
conda activate qualimap_env
conda install -c conda-forge parallel
```
##### Step 6: run:
```bash
./run_qualimap.sh
```

# 7️⃣ MultiQC after Qualimap

Once we finish running **Qualimap BAM QC**, each sample has its own folder with detailed HTML and PDF reports.  
While these per-sample reports are useful, it becomes inefficient to open them one by one when working with many TB isolates.  
This is where **MultiQC** is especially powerful:  
- It scans all the Qualimap output folders.  
- It aggregates mapping quality, depth, and coverage statistics across all samples.  
- It provides an **at-a-glance overview** of problematic samples (e.g., low coverage, uneven depth, or poor alignment).  
- It ensures results are **standardized and shareable** across teams.

### Run MultiQC on Qualimap outputs
```bash
multiqc qualimap_reports -o multiqc_report
```
📊 The final summary will be available in:  multiqc_report/multiqc_report.html

# 8️⃣ TB Variant Filter
The **tb_variant_filter** tool is a specialized filtering framework designed for **Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb)** sequencing data. Unlike generic variant filtering tools (e.g., GATK VariantFiltration, bcftools filter), this tool leverages TB-specific genomic features and known problematic regions of the **H37Rv reference genome** to ensure only **high-confidence variants** are kept for downstream analysis.

---
## ✨ Why Filtering is Important
Raw variant calls from Snippy (or any variant caller) often include:
- **False positives** due to sequencing errors or mapping ambiguity.  
- Variants in **repetitive regions**, where reads cannot be uniquely aligned.  
- Low-quality calls with insufficient coverage or poor base quality.  
If left unfiltered, these can:
- Lead to **spurious drug resistance predictions**.  
- Introduce **noise in phylogenetic analyses**, distorting transmission clustering.  
- Inflate **SNP distances**, causing misinterpretation of outbreaks.  
---

## ⚙️ What `tb_variant_filter` Does
This tool applies a series of filters tailored to *M. tuberculosis*. The main steps include:

1. **Masking problematic genomic regions**  
   - Excludes SNPs in highly repetitive or poorly mappable regions (e.g., **PE/PPE gene families**, mobile genetic elements).  
   - These regions are known to cause alignment artifacts and unreliable variant calls.  
2. **Depth-based filtering**  
   - Removes variants with **insufficient coverage** (low read depth).  
   - Ensures only variants supported by enough reads are retained.  
3. **Quality-based filtering**  
   - Filters out variants with **low base or mapping quality**.  
   - Retains only high-confidence SNPs/indels.  
4. **Retains core genome SNPs**  
   - Focuses on SNPs in **conserved coding regions**, which are more reliable for drug resistance and phylogeny.  
   - This ensures consistency across isolates for comparative analysis.  
---

## ✅ Benefits of Using `tb_variant_filter`
- **TB-specific**: Tailored to the H37Rv reference genome.  
- **Improved accuracy**: Removes false positives that generic tools often miss.  
- **Reliable resistance prediction**: Only keeps SNPs truly linked to drug resistance.  
- **Cleaner phylogenies**: Results in more robust clustering and outbreak inference.  
- **Standardization**: Widely adopted in TB genomic epidemiology pipelines, making results comparable across studies.

# 9️⃣ TB-Profiler from FASTQ Files

---

**TB-Profiler** is a specialized bioinformatics tool designed for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.  
It performs **variant calling, lineage determination, and drug resistance prediction** in a single streamlined pipeline.  

### Why we use TB-Profiler in our workflow
- 🧪 **Drug Resistance Prediction** → Screens for known resistance mutations against both first- and second-line TB drugs.  
- 🌍 **Lineage Typing** → Classifies isolates into globally recognized TB lineages (e.g., Lineage 1–7).  
- 🔄 **Flexible Input** → Accepts FASTQ, BAM, or VCF files depending on our analysis stage.  
- 📊 **Clear Outputs** → Generates both human-readable reports (`.txt`) and structured machine-readable files (`.json`).  
- ⚡ **Speed & Integration** → Built on efficient tools like `bcftools` and integrates easily into TB genomics pipelines.  

### Why it matters
- Provides **actionable insights for public health**: drug resistance, lineage distribution, and outbreak tracking.  
- Avoids the need to manually cross-reference mutations with multiple TB resistance databases.  
- Standardized and widely adopted in the TB research community, making our results **comparable across studies**.

# 10️⃣ BCFTools Consensus Generation

After filtering VCFs with **tb_variant_filter**, we generate **sample-specific consensus sequences**.  
This allows us to produce FASTA sequences representing the **full genome of each isolate**, incorporating only **high-confidence variants** relative to the reference genome (*H37Rv*).  

## Why consensus sequences are important
- Provide a **single representative genome** per sample for downstream analyses.  
- Used in **phylogenetic reconstruction**, outbreak investigation, and comparative genomics.  
- Incorporates **only reliable SNPs and indels**, reducing noise from sequencing errors.  
- Standardizes genome representations across multiple isolates.  
---

##### Step 1: Compress and index each filtered VCF
```bash
for vcf in tb_variant_filter_results/*.vcf; do
    bgzip -c "$vcf" > "${vcf}.gz"
    bcftools index "${vcf}.gz"
done
```
##### Step 2: Create a script to generate consensus sequences
```bash
nano generate_consensus_all.sh
```
##### Step 3: Paste this code
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Activate bcftools environment
source $(conda info --base)/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate tb_consensus_env

# Current directory
CURDIR=$(pwd)

# Directories
VCFDIR="$CURDIR/tb_variant_filter_results"
OUTDIR="$CURDIR/consensus_sequences"
mkdir -p "$OUTDIR"

# Loop through all filtered VCFs
for vcf in "$VCFDIR"/*.vcf; do
    sample=$(basename "$vcf" .vcf)
    echo "Processing $sample ..."

    # Compress VCF with bgzip
    bgzip -c "$vcf" > "$vcf.gz"

    # Index the compressed VCF
    bcftools index "$vcf.gz"

    # Generate consensus FASTA
    bcftools consensus -f "$CURDIR/H37Rv.fasta" "$vcf.gz" \
        | sed "1s/.*/>$sample/" \
        > "$OUTDIR/${sample}.consensus.fasta"

    echo "✅ $sample consensus generated with sample-based header."
done

echo "🎉 All consensus sequences saved in $OUTDIR."
```

##### Step 4: Make the script executable

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Check Consensus FASTA Lengths

After generating consensus sequences, it's important to **verify the genome length** for each sample.  
This ensures no sequences are truncated or incomplete due to missing coverage or filtering.

---

### 📏 Calculating Consensus Genome Lengths

We can check the length of each consensus FASTA sequence to ensure completeness and consistency.  
This helps verify that consensus sequences cover the full *M. tuberculosis* genome (~4.4 Mbp) and can reveal missing regions.

### Using `grep` and `wc`
We remove the FASTA headers (`>` lines) and count the remaining nucleotides to get the total genome length:

```bash
for f in consensus_sequences/*.fasta; do
    sample=$(basename "$f")
    # Remove header lines and count remaining characters
    length=$(grep -v ">" "$f" | tr -d '\n' | wc -c)
    echo "$sample : $length bp"
done
```

to save the result in csv file 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory with consensus FASTAs
FASTA_DIR="consensus_sequences"

# Output CSV file
OUTPUT_CSV="consensus_lengths.csv"

# Write CSV header
echo "Sample,Length_bp" > "$OUTPUT_CSV"

# Loop over FASTA files
for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fasta; do
    sample=$(basename "$f" .fasta)
    # Remove header lines and count nucleotides
    length=$(grep -v ">" "$f" | tr -d '\n' | wc -c)
    # Append to CSV
    echo "$sample,$length" >> "$OUTPUT_CSV"
done

echo "✅ Consensus genome lengths saved to $OUTPUT_CSV"
```

### Rename the FASTA files

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Rename all consensus FASTA files in consensus_sequences
FASTA_DIR="consensus_sequences"

for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.snps.filtered.consensus.fasta; do
    mv "$f" "${f/.snps.filtered.consensus/}"
done

echo "✅ All consensus FASTA files have been renamed."
```

###  Update headers inside the FASTA files
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update headers inside the renamed FASTA files
FASTA_DIR="consensus_sequences"

for f in "$FASTA_DIR"/*.fasta; do
    sample=$(basename "$f" .fasta)
    awk -v s="$sample" '/^>/{print ">" s; next} {print}' "$f" > "${f}.tmp" && mv "${f}.tmp" "$f"
    echo "✅ Updated header in: $(basename "$f")"
done

echo "🎉 All FASTA headers have been successfully updated."
```

# 1️⃣2️⃣ Multiple Sequence Alignment with MAFFT

MAFFT v7.490 requires **a single FASTA file** as input.  
It **cannot take multiple FASTA files** on the command line directly, otherwise it interprets filenames as options.

---

##### Step 1: Merge all consensus FASTAs
Combine all individual consensus sequences into one multi-FASTA file:

```bash
cat consensus_sequences/*.fasta > consensus_sequences/all_consensus.fasta
```
##### Step 2: Run MAFFT
Perform multiple sequence alignment on the merged file:
```bash
mafft --auto --reorder --thread -1 consensus_sequences/all_consensus.fasta > consensus_sequences/aligned_consensus.fasta
```

##### Step 3: Verify the alignment
Quickly inspect the top of the aligned FASTA:
```bash
head consensus_sequences/aligned_consensus.fasta
```
