ðŸ§¬ MTB Illumina Sequence Analysis & Pangenome Construction

Welcome to the MTB Sequence Analysis Hub! ðŸš€

This repository is a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing Illumina sequencing data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. From raw reads to a complete pangenome, this workflow streamlines every step of genomic analysis. Whether your data is single-end or paired-end, you can:

âœ… Preprocess & trim reads for high-quality data

âœ… Align reads to the reference genome (H37Rv)

âœ… Call variants and generate consensus genomes

âœ… Construct a pangenome to explore core and accessory genes

âœ… Visualize genomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships
