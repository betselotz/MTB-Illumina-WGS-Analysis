### MTBC Species  
<details>
  <summary>🦠 MTBC Species Overview</summary>

The **Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)** consists of several genetically related species that cause tuberculosis in humans and animals:  

- 🧍 **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** – the primary human pathogen; responsible for the majority of TB cases globally; primarily infects the lungs but can cause extrapulmonary TB.  
- 🐄 **Mycobacterium bovis** – mainly infects cattle; can cause zoonotic TB in humans through unpasteurized dairy or close contact; used in BCG vaccine derivation.  
- 🌍 **Mycobacterium africanum** – largely restricted to West Africa; causes human TB; less virulent than *M. tuberculosis*, but important regionally.  
- 🌿 **Mycobacterium canettii** – rare; mostly reported in East Africa; considered ancestral-like, showing higher genetic diversity; primarily human infections.  
- 🐀 **Mycobacterium microti** – primarily infects wild rodents (voles); occasionally causes TB in humans; used in some experimental TB models.  
- 🦭 **Mycobacterium pinnipedii** – infects seals and other pinnipeds; zoonotic infections are rare in humans.  
- 🐐 **Mycobacterium caprae** – mainly infects goats and other livestock; can occasionally infect humans; prevalent in parts of Europe.  
- 🐖 **Mycobacterium orygis** – infects various wild and domestic animals including antelopes, cattle, and occasionally humans; mainly reported in South Asia.  
- 🐂 **Mycobacterium mungi** – infects banded mongooses in Africa; causes wildlife TB; rare human relevance.  
- 🐘 **Mycobacterium suricattae** – infects meerkats in Southern Africa; wildlife pathogen with ecological importance.  
- 🐏 **Mycobacterium caprae-like strains** – occasionally distinguished in livestock or wildlife; emphasizes host-adapted diversity within MTBC.  

These species differ in **host preference, geographic distribution, virulence, and zoonotic potential**, highlighting the importance of genomic surveillance and comparative studies for TB control.

### *M. tuberculosis* Lineages  

<details>
  <summary>🌐 MTBC Lineages Overview</summary>

Genomic studies have identified **10 major lineages** of MTBC based on SNPs, large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs), and phylogeny. These lineages show differences in **geographic distribution, host adaptation, virulence, and drug-resistance association**:  

1. 🟢 **Lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic / EAI – East African-Indian)** – Predominantly found in East Africa, India, and Southeast Asia; associated with slow progression of disease in some regions.  
2. 🔴 **Lineage 2 (East-Asian / Beijing)** – Widespread in East Asia and parts of Russia; often associated with multidrug resistance and high virulence.  
3. 🔵 **Lineage 3 (East-African-Indian / CAS – Central Asian Strain)** – Found in South Asia and East Africa; linked to moderate transmission and some drug-resistance profiles.  
4. 🟡 **Lineage 4 (Euro-American / LAM, Haarlem, X-type, T-type)** – Globally widespread; highly successful in transmission; includes multiple sublineages.  
5. 🟣 **Lineage 5 (West African 1 / *M. africanum* type 1)** – Mostly restricted to West Africa; slower progression of TB; less virulent than L4.  
6. 🟤 **Lineage 6 (West African 2 / *M. africanum* type 2)** – West Africa; similar epidemiology to Lineage 5; historically associated with specific ethnic populations.  
7. 🟠 **Lineage 7** – Restricted to Ethiopia; ancient lineage with unique SNP markers; less studied, may have local host adaptation.  
8. 🟣 **Lineage 8** – Discovered in Rwanda and Uganda; deep-branching, highly ancestral; limited prevalence, provides insight into MTBC evolution.  
9. ⚫ **Lineage 9** – Identified in East Africa; rare; distinct SNP profile; contributes to regional TB genetic diversity.  
10. ⚪ **Lineage 10** – Recently reported in East/Central Africa; very limited information; potentially ancestral lineage with unique genomic characteristics.  

> Understanding MTBC species and lineages is critical for **epidemiology, phylogenetics, outbreak tracing, and drug-resistance surveillance**, as different lineages can show varying transmission dynamics and treatment outcomes.

### *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* Sublineages  

<details>
  <summary>🔍 MTBC Sublineages</summary>
*M. tuberculosis* lineages are further divided into **sublineages** based on phylogenetic SNP markers, large sequence polymorphisms, and other genomic signatures. Sublineages reflect **microevolution, genomic diversity, and lineage-specific traits**:  

- 🟢 **Lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic / EAI – East African-Indian):**  
  - Sublineages: L1.1, L1.2, L1.3  
  - Also called “East African-Indian” sublineages

  - Sublineages: L6.1, L6.2 (limited description)  
  - Distinct SNP patterns and genomic deletions separate it from L5  
  - Important for studying regional adaptation and genomic evolution  
- 🟠 **Lineage 7:**  
  - Ancient lineage restricted to Ethiopia  
  - Unique SNP markers and genomic signatures distinguish it from other lineages  
  - Limited sublineage information due to low prevalence
